BLACKPINK in your area</br>
BLACKPINK in your area</br></br>
Been a bad girl, I know I am</br>
And I’m so hot, I need a fan</br>
I don’t want a boy, I need a man</br></br>
Click-clack badda bing badda boom</br>
All eyes on me when I step in the room</br>
If you don't know, better ask somebody</br>
Watch your man hit the deck like</br>
pang pang pang</br>
Rang pang para para pang pang pang</br>
Raise your glass to the roof</br>
like jang jang jang</br>
Hands up, lit with a</br>
bottle full o' henny</br>
Watch your mouth when you</br>
‘bout to speak my name : Jennie</br></br>

Dancing, the lights</br>
surrounding me, now I’m done</br>
Black to the pink</br>
I’m special now you know, Oh yes</br>
I don’t care if they</br>
look at me, I’ll dance</br>
Like dundundundundun dundundundundun</br>
Boom boom boom boom bow</br>

I was warned of the</br></br>

dangers that could come</br>
With love and constantly</br>
repressed my heart</br>
If you pour your heart</br>
out just for anyone</br>
you're bound to get hurt eh</br></br>

I was fine, thought I was doing alright</br>
but then you came again just</br>
crashing down on my life</br>
I knew that i should</br>
have kept my guard up</br>
I'm falling for you again</br></br>

I can't help myself from trembling</br></br>

On and on and on~</br>
I have lost control of everything</br>
so let me inside your world</br></br>

Look at me Look at me now</br>
burn me to the ground</br>
now you're spinning me around</br>
Pull me closer</br></br>

Cause loving you's</br>
like playing with fire</br></br>

Oh oh Oh oh</br>
My love is on fire ooh</br>
(Now burn baby burn)</br>
Playing with fire</br>
Oh oh oh oh</br>
My love is on fire ooh</br>
(So don't play with me boy)</br>
Playing with fire</br></br>

Oh no I've come too deep I'm</br></br>

trapped inside your world</br>
suddenly this doesn't</br>
feel like a game anymore</br>
Reaching for you hands you pull me</br>
back into the start</br>
know your love, it won't fool me</br>
Is this healing me or killing</br>
me now how should i find out?</br>
you stole my heart, how do</br>
I figure your crime out?</br></br>

You set my heart on fire now</br></br>

it's burning to the rhythm</br>
Kiss him while I diss him I</br>
don't know but I miss him</br>
Such an addiction now</br>
your love is my crack</br>
Can't you see my heart turning black</br></br>

I can't help myself from trembling</br>
On and on and on~</br>
I have lost control of everything</br>
Let me give you all my love</br></br>

Look at me Look at me now</br>
burn me to the ground</br>
now you're spinning me around</br>
Pull me closer</br></br>

Cause loving you's</br>

Oh oh Oh oh</br></br>

My love is on fire ooh</br></br>

(Now burn baby burn)</br>
Playing with fire</br>
My love is on fire ooh</br>
(So don't play with me boy)</br>
Playing with fire</br></br>

I'm falling, loosing all control</br></br>

and this fire quickly</br>
spreads inside of me</br>
It is too late to stop now</br>
come with me</br>
and we'll let it burn my heart away</br></br>

Everything that you do’s hurting me</br></br>

I keep aching when I am with you</br>
You leave me to cry, not saying sorry</br>
And I still cannot live without you</br>
Please, don’t let me go</br>
Just give me some more time,</br>
come and hear what I say</br>
I just want you to stay</br>
I want you in my life</br></br>

Why don’t you have any feelings for me?</br>
Ohoh Move on?</br>
No, I don’t want love to go</br>
I stare at the mirror instead, ohoh</br>
You take my love for</br>
granted every single time</br>
But I still want you, I want you to</br>
Stay, stay, stay with mev
The sound of rain, it is our melody</br></br>

It makes me cry for you and me, eh eh</br>
Your scent is sweet the sweetest felony</br>
Tell me just why you can’t love me</br>
All I want is your</br></br>

What you want, want, want?</br>
Girls wanna have some fun</br>
We go dumb, dumb, dumb</br>
Yeah, girls wanna have some fun</br>
We ain't done, done, done</br>
(Let's go)</br></br>

Whatta bum, bum, whatta bum, bum</br>
Whatta bum, bum, whatta bum, bum (Hey)</br>
Whatta bum, bum, whatta bum, bum</br>
Whatta bum, bum, whatta bum, bum (Oh)</br>
Whatta bum, bum, whatta bum, bum</br>
Whatta bum, bum, whatta bum, bum (Hey)</br>
Whatta bum, bum, whatta bum, bum</br>
Whatta bum, bum, whatta bum, bum</br></br></br>

If you really, really love me, then tell me</br>
Say you can't live one day without me, really, really</br>
Say you want me, that you're crazy about me really</br>
If you really, really want me, then tell me</br>
Say you'll never look at anyone else, really, really</br>
Tell me you're not like the other guys, really</br></br>

Say you'll pick up the stars in the sky (Uh)</br>
Be good when you have me, we don't have much time (Uh-huh)</br>
Say that when you see the other girls, you don't care at all</br>
Sometimes I want to hear these white lies</br>
All the girls around you have nothing to offer</br>
Stop talking to them, cut them off from your life</br>
You will come to me anyway</br>
Better act like you know, boy</br>
Better act like you know, boy</br></br>

Eyes have been callin' me, baby</br>
Body been tellin' me, "Take me"</br>
Boys have been sayin' to date me</br>
Your lips should be sayin' the same thing</br>
For real, what's the deal?</br>
Got a feelin' you feelin' me</br>
Ay, but I don't play with them fakes</br>
Keep it real with me</br></br>

If you really, really love me, then tell me</br>
Say you can't live one day without me, really, really</br>
Say you want me, that you're crazy about me really</br>
If you really, really want me, then tell me</br>
Say you'll never look at anyone else, really, really</br>
Tell me you're not like the other guys, really</br></br>

If you kiss me once, I'll do it twice</br>
I'll stop you if you cross the line, no, no</br>
If both our eyes meet, haha, hehe, hoho</br>
Lately I was lonely because of you, no more</br>
When you drink, don't ignore my calls, yeah</br>
Don't believe me when I say it's over, yeah</br>
It's not complicated, as easy as one, two, three</br>
Imagine how it'll be when we become one</br>

Want a romance like the old times</br>
Want to slow dance when it's show time</br>
Just me and you (Just me and you)</br>
And that slow jam that we both like</br>
That playlist, my favorite, so play it</br>
But baby, F a love song</br>
I need you to say it, say it</br></br>

If you really, really love me, then tell me</br>
Say you can't live one day without me, really, really</br>
Say you want me, that you're crazy about me really</br>
If you really, really want me, then tell me</br>
Say you'll never look at anyone else, really, really</br>
Tell me you're not like the other guys, really</br></br>

I gotta know that you're for real</br>
Really, really, really</br>
I gotta know that you're for real</br>
Really, really, really</br>
I gotta know that you're for real</br>
Really, really, really</br>
I gotta know that you're for real</br>
Really, really, really</br></br></br>
